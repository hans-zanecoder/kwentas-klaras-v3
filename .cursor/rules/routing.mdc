# Nuxt 3 Routing Patterns

## CRITICAL: Nuxt 3 Routing Rules
- **NEVER nest dynamic routes under a dynamic segment** - This creates route conflicts
- **ALWAYS place dynamic segments `[id]` as the LAST segment** in nested routes

## Correct vs Incorrect Patterns

### ✅ CORRECT Examples:
- `pages/admin/projects/edit/[id].vue` → `/admin/projects/edit/:id`
- `pages/admin/projects/add-budget/[id].vue` → `/admin/projects/add-budget/:id`
- `pages/admin/projects/add-obligation/[id].vue` → `/admin/projects/add-obligation/:id`
- `pages/admin/projects/add-disbursement/[id].vue` → `/admin/projects/add-disbursement/:id`
- `pages/admin/projects/[id].vue` → `/admin/projects/:id`

### ❌ INCORRECT Examples (AVOID):
- `pages/admin/projects/[id]/add-budget.vue` → Creates routing conflicts!
- `pages/admin/projects/[id]/edit.vue` → Creates routing conflicts!
- `pages/admin/projects/[id]/add-obligation.vue` → Creates routing conflicts!

## Navigation Guidelines
- Use `router.push()` with the correct path structure
- **Navigation paths MUST match file structure exactly**
- Example: If file is `pages/admin/projects/add-budget/[id].vue`, navigation must be `/admin/projects/add-budget/${id}`

## Route Matching
- Nuxt matches routes by file structure
- File structure determines the URL pattern
- Always verify navigation paths match the file location
